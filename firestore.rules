/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, often referred to as a
 * "user data silo." All data is considered private and is only accessible by the
 * user who created it, with an explicit exception for admin users who have
 * read-only access to specific collections for administrative purposes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is hierarchically organized to enforce the ownership model. All
 * user-generated content, including assessments and their corresponding
 * questionnaire responses, is nested under a user-specific path:
 * /users/{userId}/... This structure makes security rules simple, efficient,
 * and highly secure, as ownership can be determined directly from the document path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Privacy for Users: A user can only read and write their own data.
 *   Access to another user's data is explicitly denied.
 * - Admin Read Access: Users with an 'isAdmin' custom claim can read data
 *   across all users, but cannot write or delete it. This is achieved via a
 *   collection group query rule.
 * - No Public Listing for Users: It is impossible for a non-admin to list all
 *   assessments or users in the database.
 * - Path-Based Security: Ownership is determined by the {userId} wildcard in the
 *   document path, which is the most performant way to enforce user-specific
 *   access. This avoids costly `get()` calls to other documents for authorization.
 * - Relational Integrity: On document creation, rules ensure that internal ID
 *   fields (e.g., `assessmentId`) match the corresponding IDs in the document
 *   path, preventing data from being misplaced. These IDs are immutable on update.
